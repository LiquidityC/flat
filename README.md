# Flat
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LiquidityC/flat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LiquidityC/flat)

## About
Flat is a 2D game engine based on SDL2. It's currently in progress with no deadline for completion. It will
be completed when I'm happy with it.
The main goal was to create an engine where writing code was what you mainly did. No drag and drop UIs no autogenerated
code. Just pure C++ to make your game.
The engine is growing rather frequently and the API changes a lot. But the API should be kept up to date if I'm doing my job right.

## Features
- Simple collision handling
- Parallax effects
- Music and sound
- Game controller support
- hiDPI screen support

## Compiling
Before compiling you need to install SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf

- Clone the project and navigate to the root folder
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make

## Getting started
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <flat/flat.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	std::cout << "Loading Flat" << std::endl;
	flat2d::FlatBuilder *flat = new flat2d::FlatBuilder();
	flat->loadSDL("Flat Demo", 60, 800, 600);
	flat2d::GameEngine *engine = flat->getGameEngine();

	flat2d::EntityContainer *container = flat->getGameData()->getEntityContainer();
    // You can register your objects to the container here. Objects extend the Entity class in flat

	// Create the callback methods
	auto stateCallback = [](flat2d::GameData *gameData) -> flat2d::GameStateAction {
		return flat2d::GameStateAction::NOOP;
	};
	auto handleCallback = [](const SDL_Event& event) -> void {
		// Nothing to do here
	};

	std::cout << "Starting the engine" << std::endl;
    // stateCallback and handleCallback can be omitted if you don't need them
	engine->run(stateCallback, handleCallback);
	std::cout << "Exiting" << std::endl;

	delete flat;
}
```
